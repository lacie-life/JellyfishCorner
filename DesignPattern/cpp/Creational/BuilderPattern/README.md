# Builder Pattern

*The Builder pattern is concerned with the creation of complicated objects, that is, objects that cannot be built up in a single-line constructor call. These types of objects may themselves be composed of other objects and might involve less-than-obvious logic, necessitating a separate component specifically dedicated to object construction.*
