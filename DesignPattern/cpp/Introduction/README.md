## Important Concept

### The SOLID Design Principles

- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
  
*each class has only one responsibility, and therefore has onl one reason to change*

- Open-Closed Principle (OCP)

*open for extension but closed for modification*

- Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

*if an interface takes an object of type Parent, it should equally take an object of type Child without anything breaking*

- Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

*split up interfaces so that implementors can pick and choose depending on their needs*

- Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

*High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions*

*Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions*
