## Common image transformation types

- <b>Affine transformation: </b> A linear mapping method that preserves points, straight lines, and planes is called affine transformation. After affine transformation, sets of parallel lines will remain parallel. In general, the affine transformation technique is used in the correction of geometric distortions that occur with nonideal camera angles.

- <b>Projective transformation: </b> A transformation that maps lines to lines is a projective transformation. Here, parallel lines can be formed with an angle that may intersect at some point.

- <b>Perspective transformation: </b> Perspective transformation is an important aspect of programming self-driving cars. Perspective transformation is more complicated than affine transformation. In perspective transformation, we use a 3 x 3 transformation matrix to transform images from the 3D world into 2D images.

### Something 

- Erosion means the removal of pixels at the boundaries of the objects in an image.
- Dilation means the addition of extra pixels to the boundaries of the objects in an image.
