# PySerial Emulator

This code is used to show examples of how you would use PySerial to interact with an Arduino. It emulates the Arduino as a source to read from and also sends data to the emulated Arduino.

## Setup your pipenv

From the folder with the Pipfile run the command `pipenv update`

If you don't have pipenv installed please follow the instructions at https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/

## Running the code

The code can be run with the following command:
* `python3 testSerialSimulator.py`

## Expected output
```

read multiple bytes =  e used to
read a line =  drive cars.
